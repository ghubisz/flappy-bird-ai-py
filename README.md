Not the classic flappy bird, I've used NEAT python module, so that an AI plays the flappy bird by itself. 

After installing requirements from requirements.txt, just run:
python3 flappy_bird.py

The AI starts training itself from genom 1, you can see the progress in number of Gen, which is listed while playing.
